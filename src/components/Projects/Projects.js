              description="In this project our objective is to create a CI CD (Continuous Integration Continuous Deployment ) pipeline in AWS cloud infrastructure. Here we use Git as a version control system for managing code of our application. After coding we upload our code to a source code management system called GitHub. From there we take our code and test the code for any errors.This is achieved by continuous integration server called Jenkins.After testing we will give feedback to the developer. This is continuous integration section in a nutshell. Now we have to create an image file using the compiled code file.For this we have to use Docker."

              description="To keep up with the pace of change required to deliver a compelling software product and to leverage emerging technologies, a three-tier architecture provides numerous benefits. It allows a developer the opportunity to extend, modularize, and be able to configure their application. The architecture shortens time to market and reduces the cost to integrate new features into software as a service (SaaS), Cloud, and on-premise applications."

For solving this architecture we use a private network called VPC (Virtual Private Network). Here we need a VPC with Private and Public subnets. After that create an Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC to access public internet."

For a secured communication across the internet we go with VPN. Two offices can communicate through internet. But since the internet is a public media, there is no security for the data. In order to provide security, we can configure VPN gateway at both ends."
